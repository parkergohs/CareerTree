<h2>What makes Career Tree different?</h2>
<p>
Personalization. Every person is different, and credentials only go so far in conveying what a person is really like
or how well they will actually perform at their work. Career Tree allows for people to really show off not only their skills,
but their lifestyle and thought process as well. This allows for a much fuller picture of what makes people uniquely capable beyond
just a few pieces of text.
